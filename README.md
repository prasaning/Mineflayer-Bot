# Mineflayer-Bot  


This code was made when minecraft botting was at it's peak.  
The bot uses sessions to login to accounts and join whatever server you want.  

sessiongetter.py  
> requires https proxies to get the session ids from accounts  
> accounts needs to be in email:password format in `accounts.txt`


index.py
> change the guild ids in the file to your guild
> add a discord bot token to the file aswell
